- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Leonardo Ribeiro.

I started studying Systems Analysis in 2001 at Catholic University, graduating in 2005. 

In 2003 I worked in a software factory for Unitech Company, where I could develop many systems, using mostly Java Platform (J2EE, HTML, JAVASCRIPT, Servlets, JSP, JPA, JNDI, JDBC, JMS, EJB), Oracle and SQL Server databases, Struts, Java Server Faces and Hibernate frameworks, also used JBoss, WebSphere and Tomcat.

In 2008 I did a specialization in Software Engineering at UNIFACS University. In this year I also had my first experience in oversea projects, for CPM Braxis company having the CITI Bank as its main Customer. I worked as team leader, doing also system analysis and System Development, using Struts and Hibernate frameworks.

In the following years, I could take three Oracle Certifications: SCJP5 - Sun Certified Java Programmer, SCWCD5 and SCBCD5 - Web and Business Component Developer.

In 2009 I got into IBM Company, my second international experience. There I could grow a lot professionally, working in a big project in ETL Team. I worked as a JAVA Specialist in the Team, also acting as Technical Leader. I worked for many IBMÂ´s Customers, developing data extraction solutions, improving IBMÂ´s data extraction Framework (XTRACT), working with Java Core, WebServices SOAP and IBM DataStage. 

In 2016 I got into the Bahia State Court Of Justice, where I could develop a lot of projects, working mostly as System Analyst and Developer. 
- Sofia: Virtual Assistant, Chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing and was trained to help people with many recurrent questions about the court of justice. I used Javascript libraries to develop, like ReactJs and NodeJS. To develop the Artificial Intelligence model I used Python Language.
- Similarity Process Finder: This is a tool that I developed using Python and MongoDB. It is being used to find processes based on text similarity. 
- IAJUS - Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Automation: I developed a JAVA Framework that helps developers to create Robot Process Automation. Then I created more than 20 robots to work in repetitive tasks, helping public servers in these tasks.
- SAJ and SAIPRO Migration Systems, using Angular, Hibernate and Soap Web Services.
- Developed solution to send judicial processes to CNJÂ´s repository, using Java RESTful Webservices.
